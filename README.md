# lc-installer-linux

The installer for Lightcord on Linux! It can install, update and uninstall Lightcord!

This installer has been moved to it's own repo in order to make maintenance easier.

## Using the installer

If you use Arch Linux or derivaties, use the AUR package. [Click here for more details](https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord#arch-linux-or-arch-based)

Execute `sh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lightcord/Lightcord/master/LULI.sh)"`

## Remarks

* If you use this script to install Lightcord, use it to uninstall again. We do have some mechanisms in place to prevent the installer from interrupting the package manager's work.
* If you use Bedrock Linux make sure that the installer's and Lightcord's requirements are statisfied in the stratus you're installing Lightcord in!
